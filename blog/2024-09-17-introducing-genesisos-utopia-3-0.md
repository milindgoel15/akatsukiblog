Story, rumors, pushbacks you might have heard it all and the only thing which stayed constant through this whole journey was our commitment in giving our users the update they deserve. So without any further ado GenesisOS 3.0 is here and here for many good reasons.

### So what's new in the Source?

1. **Beyond Ordinary:** Our unified customization settings app. No more digging through setting menus to find what you need, finding your favorite feature is now easier than ever. 
2. **Privacy & Security:**
   • Setting up a custom DNS is now as easy as just selecting it from the list.
   • Now no outsider can toggle your quick settings or power off your phone from the lock screen.
   • DNS will automatically turn off when using VPN
   • Secured with the latest September security patch, including bug fixes and addressed vulnerabilities from Google.
3. **Charging Control:** You asked for it and here it is the most asked feature in our user experience survey. Also now you can see the charging info on the lock screen

Wait, you possibly didn't think we are going to list out every new feature on this blog post right? If you're interested in finding all the new features then either flash the ROM or

### What's new in the Project?

While we were working on the ROM source, we've also been working hard to improve our infrastructure. In addition to Google Drive, we have now opted for GoFile as our backup storage server, ensuring you always have access to download links for GenesisOS. Old Builds Migration from Sourceforge is still WIP.

Apart from all this excitement, we announce our revamped website featuring a modern UI and an optimized UX for the best user experience. Don't forget to let us know what you feel about the new design.

We know we've been a bit late this time around, and we appreciate your patience. The delays were challenging for both our users and us. Our lead developer, Ayush, has been working tirelessly on QPR3 while managing personal commitments. We're happy to report that we've caught up and the road ahead looks promising.

Looking Ahead, and as teased before, we're also working on Android 15 simultaneously, so expect these (I swear I hate this word now, but being the politician I am but) soon. We are also thinking of doing LTS Version for Utopia. As usual there are no promises, we have to wait to see how much we can bring it to reality.

Last but not the least thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm for GenesisOS. We're back with a bang and ready to take your experience beyond ordinary.
