February also known as the month of love or as we are calling it *"The month of giggity"* and with that the February patch update of ***protonplus*** is here and updates to the devices on our roster will start rolling out in the upcoming days.

<!--truncate-->

We have some exciting new stuff that is added as well like our own fork of launcher 3 which will allow for much better homescreen customization and the addition of Aperture as the default camera app for all the devices you can find the rest of the *[Changelog Here!](https://github.com/protonplus-org/ota/blob/tm/source_changelog/source_changelog.txt)*

As Updated before on our *[Telegram Chanel Post](https://t.me/protonplusupdates/73)*, we have dropped ***starlte***, ***star2lte***, ***crownlte***, ***mojito*** from our build roster and maintainership for these devices are open again. We would also like to encourage anyone who meets our requirements to apply for maintainership for their device. And if you like this project and want us to keep going in the long run you can contribute by *[Donating](https://t.me/YetAnotherAkatsuki/9)* as it is the only way we can get servers to work on the project each contribution from everyone is very much appreciated.


We hope you enjoy this update and keep on *"Giggity like our old pal Glen Quagmire"*.
